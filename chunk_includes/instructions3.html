How do you know whether a sentence is grammatical? By 'grammatical,' we simply mean whether or not you think it sounds like natural English you might imagine a friend or coworker using, or if instead the sentence contains a clear error that you don't think any English speaker would make. An example of an ungrammatical sentence in English is 'these one girl became unhappy.'</p>
<p>

You'll find that you have a strong, natural intuition about whether a sentence sounds OK or not, and we just want you to report that 'gut feeling' without overthinking it. Because we want to get your 'gut feeling' judgement, we will ask you to respond within 2 seconds of the end of the sentence so that you don't overthink it. If you don't respond quickly enough, you will see a warning message to try and respond faster; otherwise, you'll see a blank screen for a bit, and then the next trial will begin.
